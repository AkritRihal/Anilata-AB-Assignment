# Action Classification System

## Overview

This project demonstrates various approaches to creating an action classification system, designed to identify and classify human actions from video data. The approaches explored include using CNN architectures, keypoint extraction with open-source libraries, LRCNN (LSTM-CNN) hybrid models, and advanced object detection techniques like YOLOv8 combined with temporal models.
